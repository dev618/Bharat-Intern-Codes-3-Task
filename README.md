The provided Jupyter Notebook code demonstrates how to predict Tesla's (TSLA) stock price using an LSTM model. It loads historical stock price data, preprocesses it by normalizing the values, and prepares sequences for LSTM training. The model consists of two LSTM layers and a Dense layer. After training, it predicts the next 30 days' stock prices. However, this example is for educational purposes only and should not be used for actual trading decisions. Financial market prediction is complex, requiring more advanced models and domain expertise.
